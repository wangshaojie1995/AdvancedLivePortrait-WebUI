- [![colab](https://colab.research.google.com/assets/colab-badge.svg)](https://colab.research.google.com/github/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI/blob/master/notebooks/advanced_live_portrait_webui.ipynb)


# Installation And Running
### Prerequisite
1. `3.9` <= `python` <= `3.12` : https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-3110/
2. **(Opitonal, only if you're using Nvidia GPU)** CUDA 12.4 : https://developer.nvidia.com/cuda-12-4-0-download-archive?target_os=Windows
3. (Optional, only needed if you use Video Driven) `FFmpeg`:  https://ffmpeg.org/download.html <br> After installing `FFmpeg`, make sure to add the FFmpeg/bin folder to your **system PATH**!
## Run Locally
1. git clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI.git
```
2. Install dependencies ( Use `requirements-cpu.txt` if you're not using Nvidia GPU. )
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
3. Run app
```
python app.py
```

## Run with PowerShell
There're PowerShell scripts for each purpose : [`Install.ps1`](https://github.com/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI/blob/master/Install.ps1), [`Start-WebUI.ps1`](https://github.com/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI/blob/master/Start-WebUI.ps1) and [`Update.ps1`](https://github.com/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI/blob/master/Update.ps1).
<br> They do the same things as above with `venv`, creating, activating `venv` and running the app etc.

If you're using Windows, right-click the script and then click on ***Run with PowerShell***.

## Run with Docker
1. git clone this repository
```
git clone https://github.com/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI.git
```
2. Build the image
```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml build
```
3. Run the container
```
docker compose -f docker/docker-compose.yaml up
```
4. Connect to `http://localhost:7860/` in browser.

Update the [`docker-compose.yaml`](https://github.com/jhj0517/AdvancedLivePortrait-WebUI/blob/master/docker/docker-compose.yaml) to match your environment if you're not using an Nvidia GPU.
